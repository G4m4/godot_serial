# Serial port communication within Godot

This super simple Godot module is a wrapper for srial port communication.
For now it is based on [serialib] (https://github.com/G4m4/serialib/) but depending on the usage it could change.
Successfully used in a real world project on both Windows & Raspberry platforms.

## Usage

Clone into your local godot/modules/ directory and  don't forget the submodule:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
